ABOUT:
astroguard is a simple code auditing and debugger tool based on gcc for embedded C aerospace applications adhering to NASA's JPL Rule of 10.

Given a pre-compiled C file as an input, astroguard will run the following sequence to ensure code adheres to the standards established by NASA JPL's Rule of 10.

1. Ensure proper installations of gcc, gda, gcov, and lcov
2. Compile the C file with highest level pedantic warning and error checking
3. Run coverage checks and output logs via terminal
4. Run lcov for local coverage tests on the code
5. Execute the GDA debugger and output pretty-printed contents
6. Place all the output into a single file
