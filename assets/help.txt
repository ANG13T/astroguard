ABOUT:
astroguard is a simple code auditing and debugger tool based on gcc for embedded C aerospace applications adhering to NASA's JPL Rule of 10.

Given a pre-compiled C file as an input, astroguard will run the following sequence to ensure code adheres to the standards established by NASA JPL's Rule of 10.

1. Ensure proper installations of gcc, gda, gcov, and glov
2. Compile the C file with highest level pedantic warning and error checking
3. Execute the GDA debugger and output pretty-printed contents
4. Run coverage checks anfd output logs via terminal
5. Run glov for local coverage tests on the code
6. Place all the output into a single file
