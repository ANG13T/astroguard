# astroguard
A simple code auditing and debugger tool based on gcc for embedded C aerospace applications adhering to NASA's JPL Rule of 10.

## About

Gcov is a source code coverage analysis and statement-by-statement profiling tool
Prints out the following:
- code converage (.gcda)
- astroguard issues 

Tool Pipline:
gcc -> gda -> gcov -> glov

## Things to mention
- Preprocessors

- GCC and Clang print out options
- GCC -> GCOV -> LCOV
Streamline tool + debugging + pretty printing

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/ANG13T/astroguard
cd astroguard
chmod +x astroguard.sh
astroguard.sh ./snippets/Rule_1.c
```

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- gcc:
- gdb: 
- gcov: 
- lcov:

## NASA JPL Rule of 10

[Rule 1](): Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.

[Rule 2](): All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.

[Rule 3](): Avoid heap memory allocation.

[Rule 4](): Restrict functions to a single printed page.

[Rule 5](): Use a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.

[Rule 6](): Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.

[Rule 7](): Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.

[Rule 8](): Use the preprocessor sparingly.

[Rule 9](): Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.

[Rule 10](): Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.

## TODO
- save all materials to a common output name folder 

## GCC Usage
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a compiler for C programs maintained by the GNU Project. It turns your C code into binary which is then interpreted by a computer. It performs static analysis and debugging. 

## Optimized Compiler [astroguard.sh]:
astroguard settings should be set to the most pedantic level of operation.
Run the astroguard.sh with your chosen C file to compile your selected file with those warnings.

## Testing out Snippets
```
cd snippets
gcc Rule_4.c -o Rule_4
./Rule_4
```
